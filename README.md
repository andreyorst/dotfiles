# .dotfiles
This repository is mostly for maintaining my [Emacs][1] configuration, although it includes some useful scripts and settings for different Linux related tools.

## Structure
The structure of this repository is pretty simple.
Each directory that is named along with default system name contains files that should be copied or sym-linked to corresponding system directory.
All hidden files at the root of the repository should be copied of sym-linked to home directory.
I should really write a script this does it automatically, but for now here's a mapping diagram:

```
.dotfiles               ~> /home/$USER
├── .bashrc             ~> ├── .bashrc
├── .config/*           ~> ├── .config/
├── .config/emacs       ~> ├── .emacs.d (for pre Emacs 27 users)
├── c_project_template     │
├── .editorconfig       ~> ├── .editorconfig
├── .git/                  │
├── .gitignore             │
├── .inputrc            ~> ├── .inputrc
├── README.md              │
├── scripts                │
└── .tmux.conf          ~> └── .tmux.conf
```

These directories and files should be excluded from copying or sym-linking:

- `.git`, `.gitignore`, `README.md` - obviously, there's no need to copy these files to your home directory, as those are git related files.
- `.gitconfig` should also be avoided, although you may edit it and use aliases if you really want.
- `c_project_template` - is a template for creating a C project, that is used by a script placed in `scripts` directory.
- `scripts` - directory stores scripts that I use directly from there, either by sourcing or by invoking from `$PATH`.
- `.config` directory should not be sym-linked to home directory, since all your configuration files will be visible to git. Only files that inside this directory should be copied or sym-linked.
