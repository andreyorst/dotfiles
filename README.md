# .dotfiles
I really love to configure text editors.  [Kakoune][1] and [Emacs][2]
configurations are stored in this repository. There also was NeoVim config, but
since I'm no longer using and maintaining its configuration, it was removed. If
you're interested in it, you can browse this repository at [this commit][3].

Also includes settings for Termite, Tmux, KDE scripts, KDE color schemes, and
other misc stuff, that is usual for Linux.

### Different colorschemes for different applications

### Termite colorscheme based on Base16 Gruvbox Dark Soft
