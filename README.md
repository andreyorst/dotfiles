I really love to configure text editors.  [Kakoune][1] and [Emacs][2]
configurations are stored in this repository. There also was NeoVim config, but
since I'm no longer using and maintaining its configuration, it was removed. If
you're interested in it, you can browse the repository at [this commit][3].

Also includes settings for Termite, Tmux, and other misc stuff, that is usual
for Linux.

### Termite colorscheme based on Base16 Gruvbox Dark Soft
