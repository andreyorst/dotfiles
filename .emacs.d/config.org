This  is my  Emacs configuration  file written  as Org  document.  The
purpose of  this file  is to  provide convenient  way to  browse Emacs
configuration  with  expressive  comments,  and  references  to  other
people's work.

* About this document
This file is  my actual configuration file for Emacs.   I do all edits
here, then /compile/  it to =.el= file. It is  convenient because Emacs is
complex tool, so I  can leave comments by myself, but  I don't need to
keep track over two files, like in Kakoune or Vim, since this document
is my configuration file and a bunch of notes simultaneously.

I try to  maintain my Emacs configuration simple and  small keeping as
much of  vanilla Emacs behaviors  as I can, but  I'm a sane  person so
some aspects which are actually insane in my opinion are changed. Like
for example, why  on Earth Emacs scrolls buffer by  chunks? It already
has =C-v= and  =A-v= for this. Anyway, I'll make  explicit annotation if I
change something so it won't be hard to notice.

Now to the configuration itself.

* Configuration
As  I've  mentioned  earlier,  I'm  using  Org  Mode  function  called
=org-babel-tangle= to  build my =init.el=  file. This means that  you only
need  this  file  in order  to  get  my  config  and compile  it  with
=org-babel-tangle= function for  the first time. After  that, every time
this file is edited and  saved it gets re-tangled automatically.

Since I'm  trying to  follow Emacs conventions,  good Emacs  Lisp file
starts with commentary:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;; init.el --- Emacs main configuration file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;;
  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; Emacs config by Andrey Orst.
  ;;; This file was automatically generated by `org-babel-tangle'.
  ;;; Do not change this file.  Main config is located in .emacs.d/config.org
  ;;;
  ;;; Code:
#+END_SRC

After this  point configurations will  be split in  different sections
grouped by something in common to them all.

** Startup
Emacs starts slow, and  I like to close it when I'm  not using it. I'm
not closing and  opening it for every file, of  like every 15 minutes,
but still, the faster it starts - the better for me.

Once I switch  to Emacs 27 most  of these settings will  be tangled to
=early-init.el=.

*** Garbage collection and file handler
The  main  problem  with  Emacs startup  file  is  garbage  collection
system. It invoked  so many times on startup that  it causes quite big
impact on  startup time.  We're talking /seconds/.  One can  raise limit
when to trigger garbage collection, but this will end up in unpleasant
editing experience. So I'm declaring  these variables to store default
values for the GC, to restore them after initialization is finished:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar my--gc-cons-threshold gc-cons-threshold)
  (defvar my--gc-cons-percentage gc-cons-percentage)
  (defvar my--file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist)
#+END_SRC

Now we can tweak GC. We need to raise threshold to prevent it running:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 402653184
        gc-cons-percentage 0.6
        message-log-max 16384
        auto-window-vscroll nil
        package-enable-at-startup nil
        file-name-handler-alist nil)
#+END_SRC

We need a hook that restores initial values once initialization done:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq gc-cons-threshold my--gc-cons-threshold
                    gc-cons-percentage my--gc-cons-percentage
                    file-name-handler-alist my--file-name-handler-alist)))
#+END_SRC

*** =package.el= initialization
Doom Emacs  uses this  to speedup initialization,  so I'll  include it
too.   In   the  Doom  Emacs   Wiki  it  is  stated   that  Package.el
initialization is expensive.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil
        package--init-file-ensured t)
#+END_SRC

Melpa is a  package repository, that I use to  get packages. Since all
packages that  I need can  be obtained  from there, I  didn't bothered
with different methods of installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                           ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
#+END_SRC

Note for Windows users: change =https= to =http=

There's recent bug with downloading from elpa. This line fixes it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3")
#+END_SRC

This basic  piece of code  is used to  update package list  if there's
none.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)
  (when (not package-archive-contents)
    (package-refresh-contents))
#+END_SRC

** Default Behavior Fixes
Emacs is  old. I  understand that  back then  it could  be appropriate
decisions,  but as  of today  they are  completely obliterated  by the
passage of time.

I'm not  trying to  insult on anyone,  but usage of  the bell  is just
insane. It's  not 1980's, computers  have their own speakers  and rich
displays, why would anyone want  to use builtin speaker?  Why everyone
should know when I'm mistaken? Disable bell.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+END_SRC

I don't  know who decided  that having backups  all over the  place is
good idea, but I don't think alike.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-by-copying t
        create-lockfiles nil
        backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.cache/emacs-backups"))
        auto-save-file-name-transforms '((".*" "~/.cache/emacs-backups" t)))
#+END_SRC

For some  reason in some  situations Emacs asks  for typing =yes=  or =no=
explicitly, instead of accepting =y= or =n=. This can be fixed with this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

Emacs displays pressed  key after some time but it's  too fast for me,
because I use Emacs on the phone  too, and the keyboard is a bit small
for lightning fast typing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda () (setq echo-keystrokes 5)))
#+END_SRC

I don't want menus on shift clicks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-unset-key (kbd "S-<down-mouse-1>"))
  (global-unset-key (kbd "<mouse-3>"))
  (global-unset-key (kbd "S-<mouse-3>"))
#+END_SRC

I  don't like  how  Emacs  handles scrolling,  and  that  it uses  tab
characters by default.  I need tab  characters only when I work with C
code and Makefile rules.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil
                scroll-step 1
                scroll-conservatively 10000
                mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil
                auto-window-vscroll nil)
#+END_SRC

I  don't like  custom,  and  especially would  like  to  stop it  from
interfering to  my configuration  files, so lets  move it  to separate
file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load custom-file :noerror)
#+END_SRC

I also don't like that Emacs  has disabled commands, and enabling them
modifies  my =init.el=  that  I  don't modify  myself.  Let's put  those
commands to =custom.el= instead:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defadvice en/disable-command (around put-in-custom-file activate)
    "Put declarations in `custom-file'."
    (let ((user-init-file custom-file))
      ad-do-it))
#+END_SRC

Another feature I  want is history between sessions. I'm  not sure why
it isn't default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (savehist-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

I use two keyboard layouts: =qwerty=  and =йцукен=, therefore I need a way
to switch between those without loosing  ability to use such chords as
=C-x=  which will  become  a =C-ч=  if  I select  Cyrillic  layout in  the
OS. Luckily for  me, Emacs provides a method to  switch layouts within
Emacs with =C-\=, so all common shortcuts will still work fine.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq default-input-method 'russian-computer)
#+END_SRC

I'm  not   using  =russian-jcuken=   here  because  it   represents  the
"typewriter" layout with number-line inverted,  so to access numbers I
need to use Shift key. =russian-computer= doesn't have this problem.

I  don't  find displaying  position  in  modeline really  great  idea,
because I need to move my eyes too much on big screen just to see what
line number I'm currently on.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq column-number-mode nil
        line-number-mode nil
        size-indication-mode nil
        mode-line-position nil)
#+END_SRC

I don't  want my files to  contain trailing whitespaces, so  this hook
will get rid of those automatically for me.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
#+END_SRC

One thing  that bothered  me is  that =C-g= is  universal way  to cancel
things  in  Emacs, gut  you  have  to be  in  exact  window to  cancel
action.  This function  intelligently  tries to  cancel regardless  of
active window:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; suppress byte-compiler warnings
  (declare-function minibuffer-keyboard-quit "delsel" (&optional ARGS))

  (defun my/escape ()
    "Quit in current context.

  When there is an active minibuffer and we are not inside it close
  it.  When we are inside the minibuffer use the regular
  `minibuffer-keyboard-quit' which quits any active region before
  exiting.  When there is no minibuffer `keyboard-quit' unless we
  are defining or executing a macro."
    (interactive)
    (cond ((active-minibuffer-window)
           (if (minibufferp)
               (minibuffer-keyboard-quit)
             (abort-recursive-edit)))
          (t
           ;; ignore top level quits for macros
           (unless (or defining-kbd-macro executing-kbd-macro)
             (keyboard-quit)))))
#+END_SRC

Let's remap default =keyboard-quit= key with this function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key [remap keyboard-quit] #'my/escape)
#+END_SRC

When using some commands that provide  prompt, like pushing to git, or
=eval-expression=,  there's  annoying message  =text  is  read only=  when
deleting past first symbol. Let's disable it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/command-error-function (data context caller)
    "Ignore the `text-read-only' signal; pass the rest DATA CONTEXT CALLER to the default handler."
    (when (not (eq (car data) 'text-read-only))
      (command-error-default-function data context caller)))

  (setq command-error-function #'my/command-error-function)
#+END_SRC

** Use Package
I use =use-package= to install, load  and configure my packages.  I find
this way very consistent and easy  to understand and maintain.  What I
like  about it  is that  it automatically  installs packages  on Emacs
startup. But unfortunately it can't be installed by itself, so we need
a way  to install  Use Package  in case  I load  this config  on fresh
system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/ensure-installed (package)
    "Ensure that PACKAGE is installed."
    (when (not (package-installed-p package))
      (package-install package)))
#+END_SRC

Now we can install and configure Use Package itself:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (my/ensure-installed 'use-package)
  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'use-package)
    (setq use-package-always-ensure t))
#+END_SRC

All  other packages  were  split to  individual  categories much  like
Emacs  settings above.  This  helps  me to  keep  track  of things  in
different packages and do not rely on search that much.

** User Interface
All user interface related settings are presented in this section. I'm
big fan of  DOOM themes, and modeline,  so I'll refer to  them quite a
lot here.

*** Default tweaks
Emacs displays splash screen once started  with no files. I don't need
it, and  I would like to  start with =*scratch*= buffer  instead. Also I
would  like =*scratch*=  buffer  to be  an Org  buffer  with no  initial
message:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-splash-screen t
        initial-major-mode 'org-mode
        initial-scratch-message "")
#+END_SRC

I don't need  all these tooltips, menus and  scrollbars. Emacs enables
all of those by default, so let's disable them as early as possible:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (fset 'menu-bar-open nil)

  (when window-system
    (scroll-bar-mode -1)
    (tool-bar-mode -1))
#+END_SRC

Also let's  use bar  cursor when  in window  system, which  is visible
only in active window:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (when window-system
      (setq-default cursor-type 'bar
                    cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil))
#+END_SRC

Emacs uses weird method of naming a window, I'd like to see a file I'm
currently working  on in the task  bar in case my  Emacs was minimized
for some reason.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default frame-title-format '("%b — Emacs"))
#+END_SRC

Also,  why initial  frame size  is so  small? When  I launch  Emacs in
terminal it  occupies whole window.  When I launch it  under graphical
environment it defaults to really  small window, which is smaller than
my   terminal.  My   window   manager  doesn't   adjust  window   size
automatically so let's just set little bit bigger initial size:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 190 52))
#+END_SRC

With this size I'm  able to fire up Emacs and get  enough space to fit
two vertically aligned windows and a file explorer together.

I like this  Adobe Source Code Pro  font. Even if I use  Hack in every
other editor, for some reason I find this font just right for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Source Code Pro-10")
#+END_SRC

I want fringes  to appear only in certain buffers  where I really need
them, so let's  disable it entirely on startup and  set them with some
hooks later.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (fringe-mode 0))
#+END_SRC

But this adds another problem. Emacs displays =$= sign at the end of the
window if line is being truncated. Damn,  why it is so hard to make it
work how I want.. And you can't simply set =standard-display-table= slot
to empty space, because it isn't ready on Emacs init.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (or standard-display-table
        (setq standard-display-table (make-display-table)))
    (set-display-table-slot standard-display-table 0 ?\ ))
#+END_SRC

Small  tweak to  mode line,  that disables  changing appearance  in non
active window.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mode-line-in-non-selected-windows nil)
#+END_SRC

Now  I can  list  some amazing  packages that  provide  some real  GUI
goodies to Emacs.

*** All The Icons
This  package provides  nice icons  for emacs  via custom  fonts. Just
don't forget to use =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts RET= after install.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package all-the-icons)
#+END_SRC

I don't use  this package directly yet, but some  other packages, like
DOOM Modeline or Treemacs.

*** DOOM Themes
This theme collection  was developed for [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM Emacs]], and  I find these
themes actually great  on its own. This package  contains nice variant
of Atom-like One theme which I like,  but it is also an amazingly well
put package, which defines colors for pretty much everything in Emacs.
It also features Treemacs configuration, which  is nice, but I want to
change a little bit of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-themes
    :commands (doom-themes-org-config)
    :init
    (load-theme 'doom-one t)
    (doom-themes-org-config)
    (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
          doom-themes-enable-italic t))
#+END_SRC

Emacs uses  white titlebar, but  since I'm  using dark color  scheme I
want title bar  to be dark as  well. It is quite  difficult to achieve
this in GNOME Shell, but I found this code [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/blog/emacs-dark-window-decoration.html][on the internet]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/set-frame-dark (&optional frame)
    "Set FRAME titlebar colorscheme to dark variant."
    (with-selected-frame (or frame (selected-frame))
      (call-process-shell-command
       (format "xprop -f _GTK_THEME_VARIANT 8u -set _GTK_THEME_VARIANT \"dark\" -name \"%s\""
               (frame-parameter frame 'name)))))
#+END_SRC

So  if  I  use  =window-system=  I want  this  function  to  run  during
initialization process, and when new frame is created.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (my/set-frame-dark)
    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'my/set-frame-dark :after))
#+END_SRC

*** Solaire Mode
This  package helps  distinguish  buffers that  have  file opened  and
buffers that  are for utilities  like file  browser. Also it  has cool
name! =\[T]/=

I really want  Solaire to treat =*scratch*= buffer as  real.  For that I
need to define my  own function that will decide if  buffer is real or
not:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/real-buffer-p ()
    "Determines whether buffer is real."
    (or (and (not (minibufferp))
             (buffer-file-name))
        (string-equal (buffer-name) "*scratch*")))
#+END_SRC

Now  we  can  set  up  Solaire Mode  and  assign  =my/real-buffer-p=  to
=solaire-mode-real-buffer-fn=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package solaire-mode
    :commands (solaire-global-mode
               solaire-mode-swap-bg
               turn-on-solaire-mode
               solaire-mode-in-minibuffer
               solaire-mode-reset)
    :config
    (cond ((not (boundp 'after-focus-change-function))
           (add-hook 'focus-in-hook  #'solaire-mode-reset))
          (t
           (add-function :after after-focus-change-function #'solaire-mode-reset)))
    (add-hook 'after-revert-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode)
    (add-hook 'change-major-mode-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode)
    (add-hook 'org-capture-mode-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode :after)
    (add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode :after)
    :init
    (setq solaire-mode-real-buffer-fn #'my/real-buffer-p)
    (solaire-global-mode +1)
    (solaire-mode-swap-bg))
#+END_SRC

If only  certain buffers  could +be so  grossly incandescent+  *have damn
fringes!* With  this package  Emacs becomes way  more like  true editor
with  actual   graphical  interface,   but  these  fringes   drive  me
crazy. That's why I wrote this  function, that enables fringes only in
buffers that are affected by Solaire Mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/real-buffer-setup (&rest _)
    "Wrapper around `set-window-fringes' function."
    (when (my/real-buffer-p)
      (set-window-fringes nil 8 8 nil)
      (when (fboundp 'doom-color)
        (set-face-attribute 'line-number-current-line nil
                            :foreground (doom-color 'fg-alt)
                            :background (doom-color 'bg)))
      (setq-local scroll-margin 3)))
#+END_SRC

Let's assign it to these hooks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'window-configuration-change-hook 'my/real-buffer-setup)
  (add-hook 'org-capture-mode-hook 'my/real-buffer-setup)
  (add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook 'my/real-buffer-setup)
#+END_SRC

There's also  another problem with Solaire  (he tend not to  skip game
cutscenes). When previewing LaTeX in  Org buffers, the background used
isn't remapped by Solaire. This function should fix this problem:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (defvar org-format-latex-options)
  ;; (defun my/update-org-latex-preview-bg (&rest _)
  ;;   "Update background color for LaTeX images."
  ;;   (setq-default
  ;;    org-format-latex-options
  ;;    (plist-put org-format-latex-options
  ;;               :background
  ;;               (face-attribute
  ;;                (or
  ;;                 (cadr (assq 'default face-remapping-alist))
  ;;                 'default)
  ;;                :background nil t))))
#+END_SRC

We need to add advice to use this function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (add-hook 'solaire-mode-hook 'my/update-org-latex-preview-bg)
#+END_SRC

*** DOOM Modeline
I've tried bunch of different modelines:

- [[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline][Spaceline]]
  Great modeline, but I was  experiencing slowdowns in Emacs startup,
  and I like my Emacs to start fast.
- [[https://github.com/dbordak/telephone-line][Telephone Line]]
  Another good modeline, but I was lazy to configure it.
- [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][Powerline]]
  This was first what I tried because I was using something similar in
  Vim. I don't remember why I dropped it.
- [[https://github.com/tarsius/moody][Moody]]
  Really lightweight  configuration for  default modeline,  which I've
  used for quite a some time.

They're all  great, but  I esperienced some  troubles with  DOOM Theme
that I use,  so I've decided to  try out DOOM Modeline.  And turns out
it's great!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-modeline
    :commands (doom-modeline-mode
               doom-modeline-set-selected-window)
    :functions (doom-color)
    :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-path nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-file nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'semi-bold)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-modified nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-major-mode nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'semi-bold)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-minor-mode nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-project-parent-dir nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-project-dir nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-project-root-dir nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-highlight nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-panel nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :background (doom-color 'bg-alt))

I guess that this is all for DOOM  packages for now, but I have to say
that I really  appreciate *[[https://github.com/hlissner][@hlissner]]* work. These  packages already make
Emacs look  outstanding.

*** Treemacs
To make Emacs look more like  a traditional modern text editor we need
a file explorer.  Emacs has  builtin package for this, named =speedbar=,
but It uses external frame and has  so many features that I don't know
if I really need. With this package, and its supplement packages I can
have a consistent  filetree inside my Emacs frame. Which  is good. But
there's more:  DOOM Themes support  this package as well,  which means
that Treemacs will look just as great as DOOM themed Emacs!

Before using Treemacs I was a  happy user of another filetree package:
[[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][Neotree]]. Unfortunately, last  commit to this package dates  to Nov 21,
2018, and since then there were no maintenance, and I was experiencing
a bug which made me move to Treemacs.

*** Eyebrowse
This  package imitates  virtual workspaces,  or virtual  frames inside
single Emacs  frame. This  is really  useful, when  you have  bunch of
windows, and you  want to open new  set but don't want  to loose other
window configurations. It works much like Vim tabs, or Tmux windows.

bar inside fringe marking unstaged changes.

      (global-diff-hl-mode 1)
      (diff-hl-flydiff-mode t)))
#+END_SRC

But I don't quite  like how it looks. So there's  another thing that I
borrowed from DOOM Emacs configuration. This function sets fringe diff
highlighting bitmaps to get nice looking thin vertical bars which play
nicely with DOOM Themes and DOOM Modeline:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/setup-fringe-bitmaps ()
    "Set fringe bitmaps."
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-top [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-middle [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-bottom [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-insert [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-single [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-delete [240 224 192 128] nil nil 'top))
#+END_SRC

*** Minions
This  package  implements   a  menu  that  lists   all  enabled  minor
modes. Emacs mode  line can become pretty long, so  this can be handy,
and perhaps I don't need to use =:diminish= everywhere anymore.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package minions
    :commands minions-mode
    :init (minions-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Window Divider
This package changes  window dividers appearance.  I want  to set them
to be  only 1 pixel  wide because if this  mode is turned  on, fringes
don't loose 1 pixel of width.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (setq window-divider-default-right-width 1)
    (window-divider-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Centaur Tabs
This  package  adds  tabs  over  main  windows,  that  display  opened
buffers. It's good for navigation with the mouse, and looks fancy.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (use-package centaur-tabs
      :demand
      :hook
      (dashboard-mode . centaur-tabs-local-mode)
      (term-mode . centaur-tabs-local-mode)
      (calendar-mode . centaur-tabs-local-mode)
      (org-agenda-mode . centaur-tabs-local-mode)
      (helpful-mode . centaur-tabs-local-mode)
      (imenu-list-major-mode . centaur-tabs-local-mode)
      :config
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'centaur-tabs-forward)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'centaur-tabs-backward)
      (setq centaur-tabs-set-modified-marker t
            centaur-tabs-modified-marker "●"
            centaur-tabs-cycle-scope 'tabs
            centaur-tabs-height 32
            centaur-tabs-style "bar"
            centaur-tabs-set-icons t
            centaur-tabs-gray-out-icons 'buffer)
      (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-close-mouse-face nil :underline nil)
      (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-selected nil :weight 'bold)
      (defun centaur-tabs-buffer-groups ()
        "Use as few groups as possible."
        (list (cond ((string-equal "*" (substring (buffer-name) 0 1))
                     (cond ((string-equal "eglot" (downcase (substring (buffer-name) 1 6)))
                            "Eglot")
                           (t
                            "Tools")))
                    ((string-equal "magit" (downcase (substring (buffer-name) 0 5)))
                     "Magit")
                    (t
                     "Default"))))
      (centaur-tabs-mode)))
#+END_SRC

** Modes
In Emacs  world Modes  are the  main thing. I'm  using Org  Mode quite
heavily right now, as well as  a lot of other modes. Configurations of
these modes are stored here.

*** Org Mode
Org  Mode is  a great  mode for  taking notes,  managing to-do  lists,
writing books, literate programming, and  many other things. I primary
use it for taking notes on different programming languages, and manage
my Emacs configuration with it.

**** Startup Settings
For Org  Mode I  need spell  checking to be  enabled by  default. Also
Org-mode plays nicely with justification, so I'll set it to =full=, as I
think that it  is the most appropriate format for  text. Org files are
capable of displaying images, so let's enable them by default. There's
also  a nice  mode called  =org-indent-mode=  that makes  easier to  see
different sub-trees.  Speaking of sub-trees, =org-startup-folded= can be
set to ='content=, so every document will look like table of contents by
default. Last but not least, let's enable =auto-fill-mode= for org mode,
so all text will be folded  and re-filled after its length reaches the
=fill-column= value.  document

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda()
              (flyspell-mode)
              (setq default-justification 'full
                    org-startup-with-inline-images t
                    org-startup-folded 'content
                    org-hide-emphasis-markers t
                    org-adapt-indentation nil
                    org-hide-leading-stars t
                    org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex)
                    revert-without-query '(".*\.pdf")
                    org-preview-latex-default-process 'dvisvgm)
              (auto-fill-mode)))
#+END_SRC

This will fontify code inside =SRC_BLOCK= sections:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+END_SRC

**** Source Code Blocks
Since I'm using Emacs to configure Emacs, I want flycheck to run while
I'm editing =emacs-lisp= source blocks. But I find it distracting to see
warnings like =;;; Code=, so let's disable it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar flycheck-disabled-checkers)

  (defun my/disable-flycheck-in-org-src-block ()
    "Disable checkdoc in emacs-lisp buffers."
    (setq-local flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc)))
#+END_SRC

Now we need to call this function when editing source blocks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook 'my/disable-flycheck-in-org-src-block)
#+END_SRC

I often  edit my configuration,  so it would  be cool to  update Emacs
config automatically on save. This function will handle it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/org-tangle-on-config-save ()
    "Tangle source code blocks when configuration file is saved."
    (when (string= buffer-file-name (file-truename "~/.emacs.d/config.org"))
      (org-babel-tangle)))
#+END_SRC

To actually make it work we need to add this hook:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'my/org-tangle-on-config-save)
#+END_SRC

**** Inline Images
Since Org-mode allows inline images, we  need a way to update them, if
image changes for some reason.  We will use hook to call this function
is supposed to automatically update inline images in org buffers, when
for some reason image was changed.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar org-inline-image-overlays)

  (defun my/org-update-inline-images ()
    "Update inline images in Org-mode."
    (when org-inline-image-overlays
      (org-redisplay-inline-images)))

  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'my/org-update-inline-images)
#+END_SRC

***** Inline LaTeX Preview
Latex preview  feature is  really awesome, but  I don't  want produced
images to be stored in plain sight. At least use hidden folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-preview-latex-image-directory ".ltximg/")
#+END_SRC

**** Org Mappings
I don't like  that my =S-tab= mapping for  Company triggers =org-shifftab=
function, so I'll remap it to use =C-tab= instead.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key org-mode-map [backtab] nil)
  (define-key org-mode-map [S-iso-lefttab] nil)
  (define-key org-mode-map [C-tab] nil)
  (define-key org-mode-map [C-tab] 'org-shifttab)
#+END_SRC

**** Syntax Highlighting in Exported PDFs
To  highlight code  blocks  when  exporting to  LaTeX  we need  =minted=
package   installed   system-wide   and    this   code   (taken   from
[[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20839/exporting-code-blocks-to-pdf-via-latex/20841#20841][emacs.stackexchange.com]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-latex)
  (setq org-latex-listings 'minted)
#+END_SRC

Minted creates annoying directories  named =_minted-documentname=, and I
don't want  them to  be in plain  sight.  So this  code here  will put
those directories to temporary folder on my system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar minted-cache-dir
    (file-name-as-directory
     (expand-file-name ".minted/\\jombname"
                       temporary-file-directory)))

  (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist
               `(,(concat "cachedir=" minted-cache-dir)
                 "minted" nil))
#+END_SRC

Now we need  to tell =pdflatex= to use these  escape sequence for proper
colors. This part is worth checking  for a more proper way of handling
highlighting, because right  now code blocks written  in language that
=minted= doesn't  support will  not be  exported to PDF  at all.   But I
don't know how to fix this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-latex-pdf-process
        '("pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+END_SRC

**** Cleanup After Export
Since I'm exporting my notes to PDF as final file format, I don't need
intermediary =.tex= file to stay.  Let's assume that these files are log
files, so Org mode will remove those after exporting is finished.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load 'org
    '(add-to-list 'org-latex-logfiles-extensions "tex"))
#+END_SRC

This will get rid of =.tex= files.

**** Executable Languages
A nice feature of Org-mode over Markdown is that we can execute source
code  blocks with  a keybinding  and see  results inside  the document
itself.   Let's define  what languages  can be  executed with  =C-c C-c=
shortcut from org mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((gnuplot . t)
     (scheme . t)))
#+END_SRC

And  to prevent  Emacs from  constantly asking  if I  want to  execute
source code, lets set =org-confirm-babel-evaluate= to =nil=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+END_SRC

**** Paragraphs
I would like to use the same level headings after certain part, so all
my   deeply   nested   notes   contained   right   section   separator
headings. This is a hacky way but it works:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
               '("article"
                 "\\documentclass{article}"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")))
#+END_SRC

**** Markdown Export
I don't  think that I gonna  use this much,  but just in case  if I'll
ever decide to export Org to Markdown, I'll need this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-md nil t)
#+END_SRC

*** Doc View Mode
Default resolution is too low:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default doc-view-resolution 192)
#+END_SRC

*** Display Line Numbers Mode
This mode provides line numbers on  the left side of the window, which
doesn't lag. I don't like that it changes width, so let's change it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default display-line-numbers-grow-only t
                display-line-numbers-width-start t)
#+END_SRC

*** Prog Mode
This isn't really a configuration of  Prog Mode itself, but some hooks
that change how programming related modes behave.

Here, I want all programming modes to include line numbers by default:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)
#+END_SRC

One feature that I think  is really important, especially when working
with lisp code, is ability to  see matching bracket when cursor stands
near the other bracket. So I enable it for every programming language.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'show-paren-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** CC Mode
These settings are for editing C source files. First, to suppress byte
compilation warning lets declare variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar c-basic-offset)
  (defvar c-default-style)
#+END_SRC

Now we can create a hook that will run for all C related modes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
            (lambda ()
              (yas-minor-mode)
              (electric-pair-mode)
              (setq c-basic-offset 4
                    c-default-style "linux"
                    indent-tabs-mode t
                    tab-width 4)))
#+END_SRC

Also, let's fix highlighting a bit:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'cc-mode
    (mapc (lambda (mode)
            (progn
              (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w" (symbol-value (intern (format "%s-syntax-table" mode))))
              (font-lock-add-keywords
               mode
               '(("\\<\\(\\sw+\\) *(" 1 'font-lock-function-name-face)
                 ("\\(->\\|\\.\\) *\\<\\([_a-zA-Z]\\w+\\)" 2 'error)
                 ("\\<-?\\(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+\\|[0-9]+\\(\\.[0-9]+\\)?\\)\\([uU][lL]\\{0,2\\}\\|[lL]\\{1,2\\}[uU]?\\|[fFdDiI]\\|\\([eE][-+]?\\d+\\)\\)?\\|'\\(\\.?\\|[^'\\]\\)'" 0 'org-footnote)
                 ("->\\|\\.\\|*\\|+\\|/\\|-\\|<\\|>\\|&\\||\\|=\\|\\[\\|\\]" 0 'font-lock-constant-face))
               t)))
          '(c-mode c++-mode)))
#+END_SRC

*** Markdown Mode
Sometimes I need to edit Markdown documents, so this package is handy.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode
    :mode (("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
           ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode)
           ("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
    :init (defvar markdown-command "multimarkdown"))
#+END_SRC

For markdown  mode I would like  to have automatic spell  checking and
filling. Basically the same setup as for Org Mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook
            '(lambda()
               (flyspell-mode)
               (setq fill-column 80
                     default-justification 'left)
               (auto-fill-mode)))

#+END_SRC

*** Rust Mode
I'd like to  have Rust syntax highlighting and  some basic facilities,
since I'm  planning to write my  exercises in org mode.   Since I make
notes in Org-mode, and  I started to use it for Rust  too, I need some
settings for Rust mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rust-mode
    :commands (rust-format-buffer)
    :init (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook
                      '(lambda()
                         (yas-minor-mode)
                         (electric-pair-mode)
                         (setq company-tooltip-align-annotations t)))
    :bind (:map rust-mode-map
                ("C-c C-f" . rust-format-buffer)))

#+END_SRC

This also means  that I could use something  to automatically complete
Rust  language facilities.  Rust  ecosystem provides  two options  for
that:  [[https://github.com/racer-rust/emacs-racer][Racer]], and  [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rls][RLS]].  I'm  planning to  use  Racer  when RLS  isn't
possible to use, like in Org Mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (executable-find "racer")
    (use-package racer
      :config (add-hook 'racer-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
      :init
      (defun org-babel-edit-prep:rust (&optional _babel-info)
        "Run racer mode for Org Babel."
        (racer-mode 1))))
#+END_SRC

There's also a package for [[https://github.com/kwrooijen/cargo.el][Cargo]] integration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (executable-find "cargo")
    (use-package cargo
      :config
      (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'cargo-minor-mode)))
#+END_SRC

Once again, additional highlighting, but for Rust:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w" rust-mode-syntax-table)
  (font-lock-add-keywords
   'rust-mode
   '(("\\<\\(\\sw+\\) *(" 1 'font-lock-function-name-face)
     ("\\. *\\<\\([_a-zA-Z]\\w+\\)" 1 'error)
     ("\\<-?\\(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+\\|[0-9]+\\(\\.[0-9]+\\)?\\)\\([uU][lL]\\{0,2\\}\\|[lL]\\{1,2\\}[uU]?\\|[fFdDiI]\\|\\([eE][-+]?\\d+\\)\\)?\\|'\\(\\.?\\|[^'\\]\\)'" 0 'org-footnote)
     ("->\\|\\.\\|*\\|+\\|/\\|-\\|<\\|>\\|&\\||\\|=\\|\\[\\|\\]\\|\\^" 0 'font-lock-constant-face))
   t)
#+END_SRC

*** TOML Mode
=toml-mode= helps  with highlighting of  TOML files, which Rust  uses to
configure project.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package toml-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Tools
Additional  packages  that  change  how Emacs  works,  providing  more
comfortable user experience.

*** Ansi Term
I'm using  it more  and more,  so I've  decided that  I should  have a
proper  shortcut  for it.  This  function  toggles bottom  split  with
=ansi-term= inside it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/ansi-term-toggle ()
    "Toggle `ansi-term' window on and off with the same command."
    (interactive)
    (cond ((get-buffer-window "*ansi-term*")
           (ignore-errors (delete-window
                           (get-buffer-window "*ansi-term*"))))
          (t (split-window-below)
             (other-window 1)
             (cond ((get-buffer "*ansi-term*")
                    (switch-to-buffer "*ansi-term*"))
                   (t (ansi-term "bash")
                      (set-frame-font "Hack" t))))))
#+END_SRC

/Ctrl+`/ seems great shortcut for this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-`") 'my/ansi-term-toggle)
#+END_SRC

Also, when I exit terminal, I'd like to kill its window automatically:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/autokill-when-no-processes (&rest _)
    "Kill buffer and its window when there's no processes left."
    (when (null (get-buffer-process (current-buffer)))
        (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
        (delete-window)))

  (advice-add 'term-handle-exit :after 'my/autokill-when-no-processes)
#+END_SRC

*** EditorConfig
=.editorconfig=  file  provides a  nice  way  to synchronize  my  editor
configurations between projects and different editors.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package editorconfig
    :commands editorconfig-mode
    :config
    (editorconfig-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Flymake Mode
This mode allows checking syntax in  the buffer.  I was using [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][Flycheck]]
package  before,  but  I  don't   see  major  advantages  of  [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/flycheck-versus-flymake.html#supported-languages][Flycheck
supporting  50  languages  versus  4 in  Flymake]],  because  I'm  using
language server protocol that integrates with Flymake, so as long as I
have  server for  a  language, I  have support  for  this language  in
Flymake.

Also let's  use right  fringe for indication  of errors  and warnings,
since it's never used, and left fringe is occupied by diff status.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flymake
    :ensure nil
    :init
    (setq flymake-fringe-indicator-position 'right-fringe))
#+END_SRC

*** Hydra
Hydra is  something like ability to  create mappings that sit  in it's
own mode, like different user modes  in Kakoune. It allows me to press
some shortcut and  be locked in a mode-like state  where keys that are
related  to  this  prefix  shortcut  are behaving  in  terms  of  this
shortcut.

This  package will  be used  in many  other package  configurations to
provide sane keybindings.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package hydra
    :commands (hydra-default-pre
               hydra-keyboard-quit

*** Geiser
Since I mostly use Emacs for studying LISP, and I'm reading SICP which
uses Scheme as main LISP flavor for explanations and exercises, I need
a tool  to run Scheme,  and Geiser seems  like the most  viable option
here, since it also provides completion for it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package geiser
    :config
    (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'geiser-mode)
    :init
    (setq-default geiser-active-implementations '(guile)
                  geiser-default-implementation 'guile))
#+END_SRC

*** Parinfer
Now that's a quality package. It makes writing LISP so easy, that I've
never thought it could be.

There's  a lot  of configuration  here, but  it was  taken as  is from
Parinfer Mode repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package parinfer
    :commands parinfer-mode
    :bind
    (:map parinfer-mode-map
          ("C-," . parinfer-toggle-mode))
    :init
    (progn
      (setq parinfer-extensions
            '(defaults
               pretty-parens
               smart-tab
               smart-yank))

*** Flx
This package provides some kind of fuzzy matching for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flx)
#+END_SRC

*** Ivy and Counsel
Ivy  is a  narrowing  framework  like Helm,  but  much  lighter in  my
experience.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ivy
    :commands ivy-mode
    :init
    (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t
          enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
    :bind (("C-x C-b" . ivy-switch-buffer)

It integrates with  Counsel that handles minibuffer,  so let's install
it too. I'm  using [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]] as a  great replacement for GNU  Find. It's fast
and  it   takes  =.gitignore=   into  account.    Let's  assign   it  to
=find-program=.  /I guess there will be  no problems/ /if a well known tool
is replaced  by something  that is completely  different, am  I right?/
Well I hope that it is used by =grep.el= only which I don't use anyways.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (when (executable-find "fd")
  ;;   (setq find-program "fd"))
#+END_SRC

Counsel  has nice  =counsel-file-fump=  command  that uses  =find-program=
variable, so it will be more performant with =fd=.

*** Multiple Cursors
This  package provides  multiple cursors  functionality to  Emacs.  It
isn't much like Kakoune's multiple selections, but anything will do. I
guess I'll figure out best mappings over time.

*** Expand Region
This package allows to expand  or reduce region selection semantically
in most languages that I work with inside Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

*** Eglot
Emacs polyglot. LSP client.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (when (and (or (executable-find "clangd")
                  (executable-find "rls"))
              window-system)
     (use-package eglot
       :commands (eglot eglot-ensure)
       :config
       (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c-mode c++-mode) "clangd"))
       (add-to-list 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilites :documentHighlightProvider)
       :init
       (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
       (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
       (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)))
#+END_SRC

There's still one  problem though. [[Eglot]] use =project.el=  to detect the
root of current  project to run server in. Which  results in the roots
of the  project is found not  exactly where the project  root actually
is, e.g. when multiple projects are stored in single repository.

*** =project.el=
In  order to  migrate  the problem  with  [[Eglot]] I've  used  to have  a
function wrapper over projectile, described in this [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/129#issuecomment-444130367][issue comment]]. But
I do not want to use projectile for that, since Emacs already features
=project.el= and Eglot uses it.  So first we need a list of project root
markers, that will hold file names which we will look up recursively:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar project-root-markers '("Cargo.toml" "compile_commands.json" "compile_flags.txt")
    "Files or directories that indicate the root of a project.")
#+END_SRC

Now we  need a function that  will test current directory  for several
conditions,  like does  it have  any of  project markers,  is it  root
directory, and  if everything fails, it  will go up one  directory and
repeat:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/project-find-root (path)
    "Tail-recursive search in PATH for root markers."
    (let* ((this-dir (file-name-as-directory (file-truename path)))
           (parent-dir (expand-file-name (concat this-dir "../")))
           (system-root-dir (expand-file-name "/")))
      (cond
       ((my/project-root-p this-dir) (cons 'transient this-dir))
       ((equal system-root-dir this-dir) nil)
       (t (my/project-find-root parent-dir)))))
#+END_SRC

This  is helper  function that  checks  if current  path contains  any
marker from the list:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/project-root-p (path)
    "Check if current PATH has any of project root markers."
    (let ((results (mapcar (lambda (marker)
                             (file-exists-p (concat path marker)))
                           project-root-markers)))
      (eval `(or ,@ results))))
#+END_SRC

Now  we  can   add  =my/project-find-root=  function  to   the  list  of
=project-find-functions= that project.el uses:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'project
    (add-to-list 'project-find-functions #'my/project-find-root))
#+END_SRC

*** Clang Format
A package to format C code with Clang Format.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package clang-format
    :init
    (defvar c-mode-base-map)
    (with-eval-after-load 'cc-mode
      (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "C-c C-f") 'clang-format-buffer)
      (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "C-c C-S-f") 'clang-format-region)))

strategy to minimize GC interference with the activity.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    :init (gcmh-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** VLF
This package  makes it easier to  view large files in  Emacs. It opens
files in chunks, but still allows to search through file with

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package vlf-setup
    :ensure vlf
    :config (setq vlf-application 'dont-ask))
#+END_SRC

*** Imenu List
Package  somewhat  similar  to  [[https://github.com/vim-scripts/taglist.vim][Taglist]] plugin  in  Vim  or  Kakoune's
[[https://github.com/andreyorst/tagbar.kak][tagbar.kak]].  Uses  =imenu= to  get information,  and since  many plugins
provide =imenu=  data it's  quite useful. I'm  using =advice-add=  here to
disable  modeline  in  =*imenu-list*=   buffer,  also  locking  it  size
preventing it from  changing when I close or resize  other windows. If
we call  this lambda  function with =:after=  advice, the  modeline will
disappear in  another window. With =:after-while=  lambda evaluated only
when =imenu-list= was toggled to be shown.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package imenu-list
    :defines imenu-list-idle-update-delay-time
    :bind (("<f9>" . imenu-list-smart-toggle)
           ("<f10>". imenu-list-show))
    :config
    (advice-add 'imenu-list-smart-toggle :after-while
                (lambda()
                  (setq window-size-fixed 'width
                        mode-line-format nil)))
    :init (setq imenu-list-idle-update-delay-time 0.1
                imenu-list-size 27
                imenu-list-focus-after-activation t))

* Postscript
This Emacs Configuration features  various cool E-Lisp hacks somewhere
that I've  found over the  Internet, and I  try to keep  references to
original places, so reader could refer to those, because I alter these
pieces of code for my personal needs and thus it may not be compatible
with  other people  tastes,  and  because I  want  to credit  original
author.

If you  find any issue with  my config feel  free to [[https://github.com/andreyorst/dotfiles/issues/new][file an  issue]] or
contact me via email: [[mailto:andreyorst@gmail.com][andreyorst@gmail.com]].

And as a final step of a proper init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'init)
  ;;; init.el ends here
#+END_SRC
